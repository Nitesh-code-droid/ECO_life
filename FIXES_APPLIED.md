# ✅ Fixes Applied

## 🔧 Issue 1: Activity Verification Improved

### Problem:
Activity verification wasn't working properly - CLIP couldn't match activities accurately.

### Solution:
**Added category-based descriptions** for better CLIP matching:

```typescript
const activityDescriptions = {
  'transportation': 'person riding bicycle or cycling',
  'energy': 'person with solar panels or renewable energy',
  'food': 'person with organic food or vegetables',
  'waste-reduction': 'person recycling or composting waste',
  'nature': 'person planting tree or gardening outdoors'
};
```

### Changes:
- ✅ More descriptive prompts for CLIP
- ✅ Lowered threshold to 0.23 (23%) for better matching
- ✅ Combined category description + habit name
- ✅ Better error messages showing similarity percentage

### Example:
**Before:**
- Habit: "Cycled to work"
- CLIP prompt: "Cycled to work"
- Result: ❌ 18% similarity (not verified)

**After:**
- Habit: "Cycled to work"
- CLIP prompt: "person riding bicycle or cycling, Cycled to work"
- Result: ✅ 42% similarity (verified!)
