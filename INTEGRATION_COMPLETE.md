## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API Connection Failed"
- Check Python API is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
- Check `.env` has correct URL

### "No Face Detected"
- Use better lighting
- Face camera directly
- Remove sunglasses/masks

### "Face Not Verified" (but it's you)
- Try better lighting
- Use similar angle as profile photo
- Lower threshold to 0.6 in code

### Firestore Index Error
- Click the link in error message
- Create the index in Firebase Console
- Wait 2-3 minutes

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. **Face Detection (MTCNN)**
   - Finds faces in photos
   - Like how your phone finds faces in camera

2. **Face Recognition (FaceNet)**
   - Converts face to 128 numbers
   - Each person has unique "face fingerprint"

3. **Comparison**
   - Compares the two sets of numbers
   - If similar enough → same person!

## 📞 Support

If something doesn't work:
1. Check Python API is running
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try the HTML test page
4. Check Firebase Storage rules
5. Verify environment variables
